/**
 * Reachability of the sub-clients through `OpenSeaAPI`.
 *
 * Every sub-client is now a public property, so a method added to `CollectionsAPI` is reachable as
 * soon as it exists. That is what closed
 * [opensea-sdk#2007](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-sdk/issues/2007), where
 * `getCollectionTraitFloors` had shipped with no way to call it, and it closes the class rather
 * than the instance: there is no second edit left to forget.
 *
 * So these tests guard the two things construction does not: that a sub-client is actually exposed
 * rather than left private, and that the deprecated flat surface has not lost a method before the
 * major that removes it.
 */

/**
 * The namespaces a consumer can reach, with the sub-client each must hold.
 *
 * This is the compile-time half, and it is not redundant with the runtime assertions below.
 * TypeScript's `private` is erased, so marking `collections` private would keep every runtime
 * check green while removing the property from the published type: the exact shape of
 * opensea-sdk#2007, one level up. `Pick` fails to compile when a listed key is not public, and the
 * annotation fails when a namespace holds the wrong sub-client.
