/**
 * Request-body casing for wallet-auth writes.
 *
 * `Fetcher.request` snake_cases every body by default, because most of the API
 * takes snake_case JSON. A handful of endpoints don't — their OpenAPI schemas
 * declare camelCase properties — and for those the default silently corrupts
 * the request. Where the camelCase field is required the call fails outright;
 * where it's optional the server returns 200 and quietly ignores it, which is
 * the worse failure because nothing surfaces.
 *
 * These tests pin the opt-out for the endpoints that need it, and guard against
 * a new camelCase endpoint being added without one.
