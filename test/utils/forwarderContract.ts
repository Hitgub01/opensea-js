/**
 * The contract between the sub-clients and `OpenSeaAPI`, shared by the tests that enforce it.
 *
 * Each sub-client is now a public property, so `api.collections.getCollectionTraitFloors(slug)` is
 * the supported call and a new sub-client method is reachable the moment it exists. That removes
 * the gap behind [opensea-sdk#2007](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-sdk/issues/2007) by
 * construction rather than by testing for it.
 *
 * The 88 flat methods that used to be the only way in are deprecated and stay until the next
 * major, so what needs guarding has changed: not "does every method have a forwarder", which would
 * now demand a deprecated forwarder for every new method, but "has the deprecated surface lost
 * anything", which would be a break.

 * Sub-clients exposed as a public property, mapped to the field that exposes them.

 * `search` is deliberately absent. `SearchAPI` holds one method also called `search`, so the
 * property and the existing `api.search()` method want the same name, and adding the property
 * would have to displace a working call. Whether the next major renames it to `api.search.query()`
 * is open; until then `api.search(args)` is the call and `searchAPI` stays private.
