   * Without it the only way to wrap requests is to subclass {@link OpenSeaAPI} and override a
   * public method, which ties the wrapper to that method's signature and cannot carry extra
   * per-request context.
   *
   * It receives the fully built URL and init, including the API key and auth headers, so treat
   * anything it logs or caches as sensitive. It is called for the instance's own requests; the
   * static `OpenSeaAPI.requestInstantApiKey` has no instance to read it from and takes its own
   * transport as an argument.
   *
   * A cache built on this must key on the credentials as well as the URL, and must not cache
   * anything but GET. Two callers with different API keys or auth tokens can see different
   * responses for the same URL, and a POST response is not a cacheable representation of one.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * // One cache per credential: the simplest way to avoid serving one caller's authenticated
   * // response to another is to never share the cache between them.
   * const cache = new Map<string, Response>()
   *
   * const api = new OpenSeaAPI({
   *   apiKey,

   *       return globalThis.fetch(url, init)

   *     if (cached) return cached.clone()
   *     const response = await globalThis.fetch(url, init)
